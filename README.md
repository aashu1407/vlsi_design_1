## Assignment Details

For each of the following cases, plot the ID-VG characteristics of NMOS. Find ION, IOFF. Also, report the Drain, Source, and Gate capacitances. Try to find patterns as parameters are varied. Report your analysis. Explain your observations and all the relevant plots. [Marks: 50]

1. Varying supply voltages of 1.2 V, 0.8 V, and 0.3 V. 
   (mention Capacitances values)

2. Varying device widths of 100 nm, 200 nm, 300 nm, and 400 nm. L= 60 nm
   (mention Capacitances values for each width)

3. Varying device lengths of 60 nm, 90nm, 120 nm, and 150 nm. W= 400 nm
   (mention Capacitances values for each length)

4. Varying W and L but keep W/L = 2 
   (mention Capacitances values for each case)

5. All the LVT, RVT, and HVT devices (W: 400 nm, L: 60 nm). Report the threshold voltage.
   (mention Capacitances values for each case)

6. All the corners TT, SS, FF, SNFP, FNSP (W: 400 nm, L: 60 nm)
   (mention Capacitances values for each corner)

7. Varying Temperature -40, 0, 27, 80, 125 (W: 400 nm, L: 60 nm)
   (mention Capacitances values for each temperature point)

Repeat the above questions for PMOS. All the observations, reports, and analysis have to be generated for PMOS as well and compare them with NMOS results. [Marks: 50]
